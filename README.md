## Background

In the realm of biomedical research, taxonomies can provide hierarchical classifications of concepts within a specific domain, serve as essential frameworks for structuring vast biomedical information, which enable researchers to navigate through complex datasets, identify relevant information, and establish connections between disparate pieces of knowledge. Traditionally, the construction of biomedical taxonomies has relied on either manual curation by domain experts, which is inherently a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly endeavor. Although some automated approaches offer the potential for handling large volumes of data more efficiently, they may also struggle with the identification of synonyms and often require significant post-processing refinement by human experts to ensure quality and understandability.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) with their advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities, has demonstrated the potential to automate or at least semi-automate various knowledge organization processes with minimal human intervention while achieving high levels of performance. Therefore, to address the challenges in constructing taxonomy for biomedical literature, we propose MedTaxon, a serverless web-based tool to assist researchers in the taxonomy construction. MedTaxon integrates interactive user interfaces (UIs) and LLMs to assist researchers in extracting and structuring domain-specific taxonomies, aiming to reduce the manual effort and improve the overall efficiency while.
